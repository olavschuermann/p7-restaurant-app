# Restaurant Reviews App (Project 7)
---
## About
The **Restaurant Reviews App** is part of of the Udacity Nanodegree Program **Front-End Web Developer**. 

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, a static webpage was converted into a mobile-ready application.

## Installation / How to run the application
1. Download or clone the project to your local file system.

2. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

4. Enjoy the app!
